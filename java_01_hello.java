// This is a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.    
// The program consists of a single class named "java_01_hello" with a main method.
// The main method is the entry point of the program, where the execution begins.
// The System.out.println() function is used to print the string "Hello, World!" to th

// In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.

//Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. And the class name should always start with an uppercase first letter. In our example, we named the class Main.

// Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.

// The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename. To run the example above on your computer, make sure that Java is properly installed: Go to the Get Started Chapter for how to install Java. The output should be:


/*Note: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.

System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).

Don't worry too much about how System, out and println() works. Just know that you need them together to print stuff to the screen.

You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;). */
